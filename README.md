# Compaq561-Inspection
This repo is for training my Computer Knowledge through practical means of hands on inspection of my old Compaq 6510b and researching the components of this old computer. This is a gateway project into deep trenches of the world of hardware and computer architecture.

## DISCLAIMER

As this is on ongoing project there will be lots of changes in the README and ROADMAP files as well as notes, documentations, pictures and code being added to the project files.
